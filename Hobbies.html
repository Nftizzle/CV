    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.appbrewery.co/">Web Development</a></li>
      <p>As hard to believe as this might sound... I do have an interest in Web Development! Thats why I've been getting into learning front end development and have got the basics of html, css and javascript down (I hope...)</p>
      <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-python-and-ethical-hacking-from-scratch/">Computer Programming</a></li>
      <p>I have also dabbled in back end programming languages such as Python but never took it further as my computer couldn't handle the virtual machines for this course.</p>
      <li><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en">Cryptcurrency</a></li>
      <p>I also have an interest in cryptocurrency as I truly believe it to be the future of currency. It has opened a lot of peoples eye's about the financial system and the value that we give things as humans.</p>
      <li><a href="https://solanart.io/">Non-Fungible Tokens</a></li>
      <p>I also have a growing interest in NFT's as they are also one of the things I predict will change the future of currency and also they way we look at peoples financial success.</p>
